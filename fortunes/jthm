their impending death. I see by the looks of you that you understand."

Hmm? What's that Shmee? Mm, Hmm. Yeeess. Hmm? Yeah. Really? Uh, Huh. Okaay. 
What? Hmm. Well FUCK YOU MR. BEAR!!! You speak LIES!!! LIIIIES!!! Stuffed with 
pure 
venom, you vile lint infested bastard!! How many more, like you, are there?!! 
How many more?!!! You can't even imagine the things I've endured!! And always 
at the 
hands of shit like you!!! You don't know the truth!!!

"Two nights ago, I was taking a walk at night, and this little chihuahua 
started following me!!! GODDAMMIT!! IT KNEW!! I ran, and finally lost it, and

"Any pile of stunted growth unaware that entertainment is just that and nothing 
more, deserves to doom themselves to some dank cell, somewhere, for having been 
so 
stupid!! Movies, books, T.V., music - They're all just entertainment, not 
guidebooks for damning yourself!"

when it dries! It NEVER stays! I HAVE to keep the wall wet!"

words are as excruciatingly stupid!!!  And used in description of me!! FOOK!"

"Without fail!! EVERY time I leave my house, it's as if I've given up my every 
right to be left alone, or treated with respect!!! You flies with your 
unyielding

me, as if I were on DISPLAY for you!!!"

blender. I'm wondering if, maybe, there really is something wrong with me."

"Think of that sensation as reassurance that you are not dead yet."
	-Johnny, to a victim (Edgar Vargas) before his death
%
"Trust me, I know what self-loathing is, but to kill myself? That would put a 
damper on my search for answers. Not at all productive."
	-Johnny
%
"I can't let you go. We've begun something lovely, and, as with all things that 
start, it, inevitably, ends! The beginning is always so fine!! But decay soon 
follows. A degeneration into the tired old situation. The rot sets in. This 
way, there is only the beauty of the start!"

	-Johnny, To Squee, after smacking a molester over the head with a 
broken pipe 
%
"Well, I just don't want you to think that this piece of shit is anything other 
than a pathetic, human defect. Nothing more. Not a monster, not a bogeyman. 
Nothing but another reason to feel better about yourself. Understand that it's 
just a person - not worth devoting any nightmares to."

"Killing someone who's bleeding to death. Fff...fuck, you people...you...how 
stupid you are. Resorting to the same old, monkey brutality, afraid to look up 
from 
your bloody dicks. Afraid of transcendence. Hey...your head looks like a 
potato. And how stupid was I? I, actually paid attention to you! Devoted 
precious thought 
to it. God...I used to love the noises I heard in my head. Hhh...I never 
should've left my room...my room, out there, I almost remember it. It's gone 
now...along 
with everything else...vanishing. Heh...potato."

to say you hate something... so easy to hate... what a piece of shit I am... I

suffering, and people like...well...ME, heh, are running around!! Suicide, 
genocide!! People are killing MOOSE!! You buy a video game system, and a better 
one comes out in a month!!! Powdered eggs?!!! Self esteem is so low, girls are 
buyin wonder bras!!! Do you see!? DO YOU?"
	-Johnny, to God

"You know, that fat little lawn gnome of a God wouldn't answer some easy 
questions!!! I'm criminally insane - I don't know what HIS reason is for being

some minor transgression or two, but this place is sick. But I won't let myself 
give the issue respect by addressing it any furth... YOU STINK!!!! Focusing on 
the mundane! Money!! Fashion!! Cream cheese!! You're in Hell and you're too

OKAY, that answers that."

"I detest sleep. I've got better things to do. Besides, I find it frightening - 
to awaken and be unsure of everything you remember about life not being just 
part 
of a dream. Waking means I've slept, and sleep dissolves what certainty I have 
left."

projectile vomit out of every orifice? I feel that right now. I want you away. 
Leave 
me to my vomit."
	-Johnny, to Jimmy
%
"Imagine a sculptor being confronted by a stranger, who, as it turns out, 
confesses to revere our sculptor. Imagine the flattery known to anybody who is 
told 
they've inspired some noble aspiration in somebody. The student then presents 
our sculptor with a work fashioned after the sculptor's own style - a likeness 
of 
the student himself. It is a monstrosity! A fucking mess. Even worse, is that 
our artist sees that this piece of shit before him is a more reasonable 
facsimile of 
his own work than he'd like to think. You fucking idiot!! Admire me?!! You 
shit!!! I'm the villain in this fucking story!"
	-Johnny, to Jimmy
%
"Just because we've similar interests does not guarantee you're going to like 
me! My foot in your ass is a good example of that. My delusionary hell does not 
agree with yours!!"
	-Johnny, to Jimmy
%
"And though this gets me no absolution, I WOULD NEVER DO WHAT YOU DID TO THAT 
GIRL!! YOU ABOMINATION OF MENTAL SUBVERSION!! OH, LOOK!! AN ORIFICE.  HOW DO 
YOU 
LIKE BEING FUCKED WITH STEEL?!!"
	-Johnny, to Jimmy
%
"As you may already know, I tried to kill you. I see how that could be 
construed as a bad thing, but the part that understands that is not the one 
running things 
in my little world."
	-Johnny, recording, played to Devi over the phone
%
"I've excluded happiness as one of those possibilities we seek for ourselves. 
Oh, I still want it, but that's beside the point. Contentment - they say it's 
the 
ultimate, but I can't even wish for that. I don't even want the desire to be 
content. I can only hope for silence."
	-Johnny, recording, played to Devi over the phone
%
"I like you immensely, Devi. And to prove it, I shall obliterate all of my 
affection and interest for you. Just like before, but different. I cannot hurt 
what I 
do not acknowledge. I don't know of anyone that I love, or of anyone that loves 
me, but I give you what I can. I give my nothing."
	-Johnny, recording, played to Devi over the phone
%
"I know forgiveness is out of the question. I just ask for what we all ask of 
the people we respect - that the thought of me does not compel you to violent 
spasms 
of projectile vomiting."
	-Johnny, recording, played to Devi over the phone
%
"Kill my stomach if I'm hungry! Shut off my want if I'm lonely! Tear off my 
genitals if I'm aroused!! Excess!!! So much excess!! It's so much superfluous 
nonsense, and I want nothing to do with it if I can help it!!!"
	-Johnny
%
"It's a frightening world to be alone in."
	-Johnny, to Squee

"It must be nice to still have the opportunity to save the cohesion of your 
pretty mind. The best some people can hope for is to better manage their 
damage."
	-Johnny, to Squee
%
"Dear Die-ary, the passions that drive us should be the ones we respect and 
admire. To feel contempt for one's own motivations is a vulgar thing. Too 
often, it 
seems, I've succumbed to less-than admirable compulsions, driven by this 
furiously reprehensible machine of mine. So many things inside that I can do 
without - 
desires and urges and what not. So extraneous. By the time I write in this book 
again, I hope to be as cold as the moon that lights this page."
	-Johnny
%
"Such amusing fiction, these stories they tell. It always comes to this. If 
they really had a desire to live, they would've been more aware of how easy it 
is to 
die, would've chosen their actions more wisely. In these moments, you can tell 
they're not regretting having hurt you. They regret doing it to your face. They 
get 
so loud. They make so much noise. I try to waituntil I'm off of the room before 
I start laughing... A blur... of... sweating... screaming... human... drama... 
but, everyonce in a while, they say things that sound like words. They make me 
think about what I'm doing. The noises make me uncomfortable. So uncomfortable 
that... sometimes... I wonder... why I don't just get myself a pair of 
earplugs."
	-Johnny
%
"Dear Die-ary, there's nothing terribly wrong with feeling lost, so long as 
that feeling precedes some plan on your part to actually do something about it. 
Too 
often a person grows complacent with their disillusionment, perpetually wearing 
their "discomfort" like a favorite shirt. I can't say I'm very pleased with 
where 
my life is just now... but I can't help but look forward to where it's going."
"Don't disturb me at home...I'm very busy!"
"Try the stew...it's delicious" (from ''Squee = Dreamtime'')
	-Johnny,(from Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors, 
his final line in the comic)
%
"I love children, they're so sweet and stay crunchy in milk"
	-Johnny
%
"Why are people so... unpleasant? Honestly, it's so difficult to truly care 
about so many things without first knowing the answers to some of the most 
fundamental, mind ravaging questions! How can one possibly respect the 
existence of something, people in this case, when that something seems to defy 
respect? 
They do such trivial things, and find amusement, even up to 'so-called' 
maturity, in the incessant mistreatment of their own kind."

Squee is Johnny's next door neighbor, a little boy who is terrified of pretty 
much everything. His mother is often too doped out on pills to notice him, and 
his 
father thinks of him as nothing more than a mistake. Occasionally, and 
especially in their last scene together, Johnny seems to consider himself a big 
brother to 
Squee. Admittedly, a mass murdering, psychopathic big brother.

Devi is a girl that Nny once managed to date. Everything was going wonderful up 
until they were about to make out, and Nny suddenly decided he had to kill her 
to 
preserve the moment. Consequently, she beat the living shit out of him and ran, 
while Nny stayed put bleeding on the floor.

"Nny... It felt like such a good thing with him. Have you ever hated someone 
for making you like them - like them so much... and then wish they would die?"

"You know what's worse than hiding from what scares you?!? Do you?! I'll tell 
you-- it's having good things pass you by because you're too busy cringing in 
idiot 
terror, hiding someplace where all you can do is dwell on shit!!"

	-Psycho Doughboy and Mr. Eff
%
"You see, he's a bit upset just now. None too pleased with the turn of events. 
I, on the other hand, feel quite lovely. Ironic, really, considering I'm known 
to 
be the depressive side of things, while he is more accostumed to being the 
manic one."

"You are nothing more than an outhouse to him, Mr. Eff, whereas I am his home. 
He will return, and when he does, that will be the end of it."

Reverend Meat is a burger restaurant sign that somehow came into Johnny's 
posession. It is in one scene, during volume 7, and attempts to sell to Johnny

attachment.

"...there's just a time to pull yourself out of the muddy gloom that sucks at 
your feet and holds you under the delusion that this is the only kind of 
attention 
there is to receive. There is a time to just pack your bag full of a deadly 
arsenal of weapons and just shake off the dismal robe that shrouds you. 
Well...perhaps 
YOU shouldn't go about it that way...No, you probably shouldn't. But you'll be 
seeing somebody who does. Kids, don't do this at home...unless you're not 
planning 
on blaming me (in which case, GO TO IT. We need more things like this on the 
news.)

"I do not adore death as if I were some idiot groupie to the lead singer in a 
band. I approach it with the mixture of fascination/terror/icy speculation of 
someone who really knows nothing. I trust, only enough, to know that I like

%
"Letters from "kindred spirits" come in, telling of how they agree with my 
views and how the world stinks, and of how they wish they could just kill 
themselves. 
Well, dispose of yourselves quietly, if you must, so long as you don't leave a 
note saying I told you to do it, you self-esteem deficient loons. I happen to 
have 
a certain fondness for existing - soda wouldn't have that lovely fizzy feeling 
if you were dead. Think of all the things you would miss; cartoons, music, 
movies, 
video games, music, art, fingernail growth, sex...well, perhaps not sex, 
depending on how weird your mortician is."

RESPONSE

CORRESPONDENCE TO MEEEEE AND ONLY MEEEEE" kind of letters. People, I do enjoy 
the 
letters, but REALLY, to most readers I am a book in their hands, not a friend 
and not an enemy. Not even a person. What matters is the book, not my personal 
responses to some lunatic's queries. Overall, however, the mail (paper and 
electronic) has been quite lovely, making me smile like the little girl I wish

"There's nothing terribly wrong with feeling lost, so long as that feeling 
preceded some plan on your part to actually do something about it. Too often a 
person 
grows compacent with their disillusionment, perpetually wearing their

life is just

people, in that world, who I would like. But like always, my hand hits the 
glass. I 
know that if I'd only waited just one more second..." -Johnny C.

"Sometimes...you can cry until there is nothing left wet in you. You can scream 
and curse to where your throat rebels and ruptures. You can pray all you want 
to

on, with no sign as to when it might release you. And you know that if it ever 
did 
relent...it would not be because it cared." -Johnny C.
